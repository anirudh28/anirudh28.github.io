With the quick increment in the quantity of web clients, the Internet has an enormousmeasure of data produced by the clients. Many people share their views regarding a topic on social media 
platforms such as Facebook and Twitter and give their feedback or review about a product on e-commerce web sites such as Amazon and Flipkart which leads to a huge amount of data. The 
identification of subjective statements from the data is known as subjectivity detection. To automate the analysis of such data, sentiment analysis is used. The aim is to find the opinionative
data and classify it according to its polarity, i.e. positive, negative or neutral feedback, known as sentiment classification and then analysing it which is known as sentiment analysis. However, 
before performing sentiment examination, the information is exposed to different pre - processing procedures which finally give the desired optimized output. This allows us to get to know about 
the publicâ€™s mood or opinion about a particular topic. This helps the concerned organization or public to improve their product or service based on the feedback received.
