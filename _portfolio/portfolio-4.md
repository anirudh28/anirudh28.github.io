This project focuses on implementing and analyzing a weakly consistent key-value store inspired by Dynamo, Amazon's key-value store. The objective 
is to investigate weak consistency's impact on data integrity and system performance under varying failure rates, message latencies, and drop rates.
We explore distributed system concepts, offering insights into fault-tolerant architectures and modern distributed system design challenges. Key 
aspects include implementing the key-value store based on Dynamo's principles, analyzing metrics like stale data reads and inconsistencies, 
evaluating performance metrics, and employing testing strategies in simulated environments. The hypothesis-driven approach will systematically 
investigate the behavior of weakly consistent key-value stores, contributing to a deeper understanding of distributed system dynamics and 
scalability challenges.
