Executed decision-making for UAV communication between Wireless ad-hoc Network and RFD900X. This was conceived via interface bridging to route Ethernet-collected data wirelessly, 
significantly extending the communication range from 1 km to 40 km, thus enabling the communication with the UAVâ€™s over longer distances.
