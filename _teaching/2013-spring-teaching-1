My job as a teaching assistant for Prof. Chee Yap involved assessing student code for accuracy, efficiency, and style, evaluating written components of exams and assignments, and ensuring fairness and consistency. Furthermore, I also offered detailed feedback to guide student growth and understanding and liaised with the course instructor about students' progress, challenges, and any potential issues.
