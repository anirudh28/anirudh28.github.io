My job as a Teaching Assistant to Prof. Chee Yap involved assessing student code for accuracy, efficiency, and style, evaluating written components of exams and assignments and ensuring fairness and consistency. Furthermore, I also offered detailed feedback to guide student growth and understanding and liasoned with the course instructor about students' progress, challenges, and any potential issues.
